        <h4>About Jay</h4>
        <p>Jay Perrone is a recent graduate from Gateway Technical College, where he earned his Web Developer technical diploma with district honors and his Associate of Applied Science in Web Software Development.</p>
        <p>Jay attended Indian Trail Academy in their Communications academy for high school, where he learned graphic design. In his classes he learned to work with Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign. In addition to his graphic design courses, he learned advertising, public relations, journalism, and took several years of Chinese language courses. Jay received a Chinese Honor Society award in 2012 for his academic excellence in Chinese language. He was also the editorial editor for the school newspaper, <em>The Pulse,</em> during his senior year, which left him in charge of the page layout for the editorial pages.</p>
                <p>Jay attended Carthage College for two years where he took more Chinese classes, various liberal arts and humanities courses, and another design course.</p>
        <p>After leaving Carthage, Jay worked in various customer service positions, retail pharmacy, and optical sales. During this time, he learned a lot of valuable life skills and began to self teach himself HTML and CSS.</p>
        <p>Jay decided he wanted to go into web and software development after a good friend started teaching him some C++ and he discovered how much fun he found programming to be. This would also allow him to utilize all the graphic design skills he had learned. To combine this with his love of learning new languages, Jay decided that he wants to develop language learning software that is more effective than what is currently available. To do this, Jay decided to return to school.</p>
        <p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, Jay took advantage of the time he had during shelter-in-place orders to begin classes remotely at Gateway Technical College. He quickly developed a knack for picking up the various programming languages he learned such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, Java, and so on. He excelled in his programming courses, and did well in his general requirements as well. He worked on two projects with real clients during the Fall 2021 semester, and he looks forward to creating more website for even more people.</p>
