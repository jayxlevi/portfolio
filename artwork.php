    <h2>Artwork by Jay</h2>
    <p class="artcaption">Since he was a young child, Jay has loved to paint and draw. Here are some examples of his work.</p><br><br>

    <div id="artwork">
        <img class="artimg" src="images/artwork/transbw.jpg" alt="Painting showing the perceived notion that gender is black and white, but people exist in a grey area and aren't so binary"><br>
        <p class="artcaption"><em>Untitled, 2013</em> Society believes that gender exists as a binary, exists in black and white, but people themselves have always existed in shades of grey. This painting aims to capture that. Initials in the corner come from Jay's deadname, but he does not wish to paint over them.</p><br>

        <img class="artimg" src="images/artwork/heartsspades.jpeg" alt="Painting showing half of a heart and half of an upside down spade"><br>
        <p class="artcaption"><em>Hearts and Spades, 2013</em> This painting is of the heart and spade card suits shown as opposites.</p><br>

        <img class="artimg" src="images/artwork/shadowsinthestorm.jpg" alt="Painting of a storm of color with shadows appearing between layers"><br>
        <p class="artcaption"><em>Shadows in the Storm, 2015</em> This painting makes Jay think of a storm made of color with the shadows of people trying to make their way through.</p><br>

        <img class="artimg" src="images/artwork/weavers.jpg" alt="Painting showing spiders weaving together worlds and the universe itself"><br>
        <p class="artcaption"><em>Weavers of the Universe, 2018</em> Jay read about some symbolism portraying spiders being weavers of life and had the idea of this painting. Ironically, Jay is arachnophobic.</p>
