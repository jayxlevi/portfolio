        <img class="artimg" src="images/artwork/transbw.jpg" alt="Painting showing the perceived notion that gender is black and white, but people exist in a grey area and aren't so binary"><br>
        <p class="artcaption"><em>Untitled, 2013</em> Society believes that gender exists as a binary, exists in black and white, but people themselves have always existed in shades of grey. This painting aims to capture that. Initials in the corner come from Jay's deadname, but he does not wish to paint over them.</p><br>

        <p class="artcaption"><em>Shadows in the Storm, 2015</em> This painting makes Jay think of a storm made of color with the shadows of people trying to make their way through.</p><br>
