        <p>During his capstone course for his degree, Jay worked with fellow classmates to build the website for the newly founded nonprofit called the Center for Financial Education and Empowerment. This organization offers pro bono financial education and guidance to people and families as they face the specific financial challenges and changes that come with a significant medical diagnosis, such as cancer. Jay, who was very happy to work on the website that will help others, worked a lot with the color palettes, graphics, and with the logo.</p>

        <p>This website was put together using WordPress.</p>

        <p>Alongside the CFEE website, Jay also worked with fellow classmates on the website for the Costa Rican specialty chocolate business Theobroma Cacao. Named after the scientific name for the cacao tree or cocoa tree, Theobroma Cacao is based in San Jos√©, Costa Rica, where a classmate of Jay's was living at the time. His classmate was asked by the owners if our class could build their website for them, and no one was more excited to work on an international project than Jay. He worked a lot with the translation plugin so the website could be viewed in English and Spanish.</p>

        <p>This website was put together using WordPress. Unfortunately, since the completion of the project something has malfunctioned with the translation plugin in the website's store and the product descriptions no longer stay translated to English.</p>
